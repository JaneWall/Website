<h4 id="BabyBackRibs">Baby Back Ribs</h4>
<em>Time needed: 3 - 4 hours</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td>
<p>2 whole slabs pork baby back ribs </p></td>
<td><p>Dry Rub: <br>
8 tablespoons light brown sugar, tightly packed <br>
3 tablespoons kosher salt <br>
1 tablespoon chili powder <br>
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper <br>
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper <br>
1/2 teaspoon jalapeno seasoning <br>
1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning <br>
1/2 teaspoon rubbed thyme <br>
1/2 teaspoon onion powder </p></td>
<td><p>Braising Liquid: <br>
1 cup white wine <br>
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar <br>
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce <br>
1 tablespoon honey <br>
2 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
<p>In a bowl, combine all dry ingredients and mix well. Place each slab of baby 
back ribs on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side down. Sprinkle each 
side generously with the dry rub. Pat the dry rub into the meat. Refrigerate the 
ribs for a minimum of 1 hour. In a microwavable container, combine all 
ingredients for the braising liquid. Microwave on high for 1 minute. </p>
<p>Place the ribs on a baking sheet. Open one end of the foil on each slab and 
pour half of the braising liquid into each foil packet. Tilt the baking sheet in 
order to equally distribute the braising liquid. Braise the ribs in the oven for 
2 1/2 hours. </p>
<p>Transfer the braising liquid into a medium saucepot. Bring the liquid to a 
simmer and reduce by half or until of a thick syrup consistency. Brush the glaze 
onto the ribs. Place under the broiler just until the glaze caramelizes lightly. 
Slice each slab into 2 rib bone portions. Place the remaining hot glaze into a 
bowl and toss the rib portions in the glaze. </p>
<p>*This recipe makes several batches of dry rub. If more rub is needed, it can 
be extended by any amount, as long as the ratio of 8:3:1:1 remains the same.</p>

<h4 id="Bacon Leek Souffle">Bacon and Leek Souffle</h4>
<em>Time needed: 45 minutes</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td style="width: 588px">
	Unsalted butter, softened, for the baking dish<br/>
	3-4 slices bacon, thinly sliced crosswise<br/>
	1 cup thinly sliced leeks (light-green and white parts only, from about 1 medium leeks)<br/>
	1/2 tsp. chopped fresh thyme<br/>
	Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  </td>
<td>1/4 cup half and half<br/>
	2 1/2 oz. cream cheese, cubed<br/>
	1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese<br/>
	3 large eggs, separated<br/>
	1/4 tsp. cream of tartar 
</td></tr></table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the 
oven to 325°F. Butter an 8x8-inch baking dish.</p>
<p>In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until crisp, 
about 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a large bowl. Add 
the leeks to the skillet, reduce the heat to medium low, cover, and cook, stirring 
occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the leeks to the bacon and stir 
in the thyme and 1/8 tsp. each salt and pepper. </p>
<p>Pour out any bacon fat left in the skillet and gently warm the half and half in
 the skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the cream 
cheese and Asiago and whisk until melted and combined. Add the milk mixture to the
 leeks and bacon and stir to combine and cool slightly. Gently mix in the egg 
 yolks; set aside. </p>
<p>In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric hand 
mixer on high speed to medium-stiff peaks. With a large spatula, gently fold the egg
 whites into the leek and bacon mixture. </p>
<p>Pour the mixture into the prepared dish and bake until puffed and golden-brown on top,
 22 to 24 minutes. Serve immediately—the soufflé will deflate as it cools. Serves 2-3 people.</p>

<p><em>Directions: </em>Put chicken pieces on grill on low heat.  Turn over every 10 or 15 minutes.  If you are using lime or lemon, cut the lime into slices and squeeze some of the juice over the chicken as it cooks (about as often as you turn it).  If you are using barbeque sauce, brush the sauce on for the last 20 minutes of cooking.  Depending on how hot your grill is, it will take about 30 - 45 minutes for breasts and wings and about 45 - 60 minutes for thighs and drumsticks.  You can tell the chicken is done when the meat begins to come away from the bone at the end for the thighs and drumsticks and when it begins to split a little on the back side of the breast.

<p><em>Directions: </em>Mix together the flour, salt and pepper on a plate.  Lay the roast on top of the flour mixture and then turn it over so you coat the roast with the flour. 
 Put a pan on the stove on high heat.  Let it heat up, then put the oil in the pan.  Give the oil a few seconds to get hot, then put the roast in. 
  After a few minutes, turn the roast over so that both sides of the roast are browned.  Slice the onions and put them on top of the roast. 
   Mix the wine with about a cup of water and pour over the roast.  Turn the heat down to low.  Cover the pan and cook for 2-3 hours.  
   If you are using the carrots and/or potatoes, add them to the roast for the last 30 minutes of cooking.  The meat is done when it begins to come apart when trying to lift it.</p>
<p><em>Gravy Directions: </em>Take the roast, carrots, and potatoes out of the pan. Take the flour left on your plate from earlier and put it in a liquid measuring cup.  
Add a little water and use a whisk to mix it up. You need enough water to make a runny paste.  Pour this mixture into the pan slowly, whisking it together as you pour it. 
If the gravy is not thick enough, repeat the process with some more flour.  If it is too thick, just add a little water or beef stock. Let the gravy cook for about 10 minutes. 
 You can put the meat back in the gravy to heat through again if you want.</p>

    	2 Tablespoons white wine (optional)<br/>

</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>If your turkey is frozen, it will need to defrost in the refrigerator for 3 - 4 days before you can cook it.  Put a wire rack in a roasting pan big enough to fit the turkey.  Remove the giblets and neck from inside the turkey.  Be sure to look under the flap of skin at the back - sometimes the store puts part of the turkey there.  Peel the onion and cut into slices.  Put the sliced onion inside the turkey. Put the turkey on top of the rack in the roasting pan. Stick some toothpicks into the turkey so your aluminum foil won't actually touch the turkey skin (otherwise it will stick to the skin).  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and put it in the oven and cook at 170 degrees for 20 hours.  Remove the aluminum foil now.  Put the margarine in a little bowl and melt in the microwave.  Add the wine to the margarine.  Use a brush and brush this mixture onto the turkey about once an hour for the next few hours.  The turkey is done when you can move the leg fairly easily.  If it does not look like it will be done on time, you can turn the temperature in the oven up to as much as 325.  Take out and carve.</p>
