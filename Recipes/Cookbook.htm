<center><h3>Directions for printing all the recipes</h3></center>
<p>In order to print the whole cookbook, follow the links to the <a href="Recipes.htm" target="_blank">index</a> and the <a href="Cookbook Body.htm" target="blank">body</a> of the cookbook.  </p>
<p>Then, on your browser select file print.  It should give you an option to <em>print as viewed on the screen</em> (this is what you want for printing the index) or to <em>print frames individually</em> (this is what you want for printing the body of the cookbook).</p>

<p>Bon appetit!!</p>
