<h4 id="French Onion Soup">French Onion Soup (Keller - Bouchon)</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 6 1/2 hours</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="92%">
<tr><td valign="top">2 bay leaves<br/>
	12 black peppercorns<br/>
	6 large thyme sprigs<br/>
	8 lbs (about 8 large) yellow onions<br/>
	8 Tablespoons unsalted butter<br/>
	</td>
	<td>kosher salt<br/>
	1 1/2 teaspons all-purpose flour<br/>
	beef stock<br/>
	freshly ground black pepper<br/>
	sherry wine vinegar</td>
	<td>1 baguette (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter)<br/>
	extra virgin olive oil<br/>
	kosher salt<br/>
	6 - 12 slices (1/8 inch thick) aged Comte or Emmentaler cheese (at least 4 inches square)<br/>
	1 1/2 cups grated aged Comte or Emmentaler cheese, or a combination</td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>Cut a piece of cheesecloth about 7 inches square.  Place the bay leaves, peppercorns and thyme in the center,
 bring up the edges and tie with kitchen twine to form a sachet.</p>
 <p>Cut off the tops and bottoms of the onions, then cut the onions lengthwise in half.  Remove the peels and tough outer layers. 
 Lay an onion half cut side down on a cutting board with the root end toward you.  Note that there are lines on the outside of the onion.  
 Cut on the lines to slice the onions into 1/4 inch thick slices. Separate the slices.  You should have about 7 quarts of onions.</p>
 <p>Melt the butter in a large heavy stockpot over medium heat.  Add the onions and 1 tablespoon of salt and reduce the heat to low.  Cook, 
 stirring every 15 minutes and regulating the heat to keep the mixture bubbling gently, for about 1 hour, or until the onions have wilted and
  released a lot of liquid.  At this point, you may turn up the heat slightly to reduce the liquid, but continue to cook the onions slowly and
   keep them from scorching.  Keep cooking and stiring for about 4 hours or until the onions are a rich deep brown.  Remove from the heat.  
   You will need about 1 1/2 cups of onions for the soup.  Reserve any extra for another use.  The onions can be made up to 2 days ahead 
   and refrigerated.</p>
   <p>Transfer the caramelized onions to a 5 quart pot. If they have been refrigerated, reheat until hot.  Sift in the flour and cook over 
   medium-high heat, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the beef stock and sachet, bring to a simmer, and simmer for about 1 hour, or until 
   the liquid is reduced to 2 1/2 quarts - during this time, you can make the croutons (see below).  Season to taste with salt, pepper, 
   and a few drops of the sherry vinegar.  Remove from heat.</p>
   <p>Make the croutons:  Preheat the broiler.  Cut twelve 3/8-inch thick slices from the baguette and place on a baking sheet.
   Brush the bread lightly on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt.  Place under the broiler and toast
   the first side until golden brown, then turn and brown the second side.  Set aside and leave the broiler on.</p>
   <p>Return the soup to a simmer.  Place six flameproof soup tureens, with about 1 1/2 cups capacity, on a baking sheet.  Add the hot soup to 
   the tureens, filling them to within 1/2 inch of the top.  Top each serving with 2 croutons: lay them on the surface, 
   do not push them down into the soup.  Lay the slices of cheese over the croutons so that the cheese overlaps the edges of the 
   tureens by about 1/2 inch.  Scatter the grated cheese over the sliced cheese, filling in areas where the sliced cheese is thinner so it
   does not melt into the soup.</p>
   <p>Place the tureens under the broiler for a few minutes, until the cheese bubbles, browns, and forms a thick crust.  Eat
   carefully - the soup will be very hot.  Serves 6.</p>

<h4 id="Hollandaise Sauce">Hollandaise Sauce</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 10 minutes</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="75%">
<tr><td valign="top">1 egg yolk<br/>
	1/2 teaspoon water<br/>
	pinch sugar<br/>
	6 tablespoons unsalted butter, clarified<br/>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">1/6 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>
	1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br/>
    tiny pinch of cayenne pepper<br/>
	
    </td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>Clarify the butter. (Put butter in a small pan over medium-low heat.  Cook until it quits popping.  Skim the foam off the top.
Slowly pour the butter into a small dish, but don't pour the cloudy stuff that is in the bottom of the pan.  Throw the foam and the cloudy stuff from the bottom away.
What you saved in the dish is clarified butter.</p>

<p>Pour 1-inch of water into a large saucepan; over medium heat, bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low.

Place egg yolk and water in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until mixture lightens in color, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. 
Add the sugar and whisk for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
Place the mixture over the simmering water and whisk constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until there is a clear line that is drawn in the mixture 
when you pull your whisk through, or the mixture coats the back of a spoon.</p>
<p>
Remove the bowl from over the pan and gradually add the butter, whisking until all of the butter is incorporated. 
Add the salt, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. Serve immediately or hold in a thermos to keep warm.</p>
<p>Makes enough for 1-2 people for eggs benedict or 2-3 people for vegetable topping.</p>

<h4 id="Mayonnaise">Mayonnaise</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 10 minutes + 2 hours to set</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>

	1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br/>
	2 pinches sugar<br/>
	1/2 teaspoon dry mustard<br/>

    </td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em> In a glass bowl, whisk together egg yolk and dry ingredients. 
Combine lemon juice and vinegar in a separate bowl then thoroughly whisk half into the yolk mixture. 
Start whisking briskly, then start adding the oil a few drops at a time until the liquid seems to thicken and lighten a bit, 
(which means you've got an emulsion on your hands). Once you reach that point you can relax your arm a little (but just a little)
 and increase the oil flow to a constant (albeit thin) stream. Once half of the oil is in add the rest of the lemon juice mixture.
</p>

<p>
Continue whisking until all of the oil is incorporated. 
Leave at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours then refrigerate for up to 1 week.
</p>

<h4 id="EnergyBar">Primal Energy Bar</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 45 minutes</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="75%">
<tr><td valign="top">1/2 cup slivered almonds<br/>
		1/2 cup pecans<br/>
		1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut<br/>

		1/4 cup almond butter (although cashew, hazelnut, walnut and even pumpkin butters will work well too!)<br/>
		1/4 cup coconut oil (check your local health food store)<br/>

		1/4 cup almond meal (simply pulse approximately 1/4 cup of almonds until it creates a coarse flour)<br/>
		

    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    	1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract<br/>
		1/2 tsp of raw honey (although, this is really kind of optional because the egg will help hold the mixture together)<br/>
		1/2 cup unsweetened whey protein powder (or 60g)<br/>
		1 large egg<br/>
		1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br/>
		1/2 cup dried cranberries or blueberries<br/>
		1/4 cup unsweetened coconut to sprinkle on top<br/>
    </td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em></p>
<ul>
	<li>On a cookie sheet, toast nuts and shredded coconut until golden brown. In order for them to cook
 evenly, you need to shake up the tray at least once during cooking</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Once toasted, pour mixture into a food processor and pulse until nuts are chopped and the mixture becomes coarsely ground 
(sort of the consistency of bread crumbs).</li>
	<li>&nbsp;In a mixing bowl, melt coconut oil and almond butter (about 30 seconds). Remove from microwave and stir until smooth.
Add vanilla extract, honey and sea salt. Mix thoroughly.
</li>
	<li>Fold in nut mixture, almond meal and protein powder until mixed thoroughly.
Add whole egg and mix thoroughly.
Fold in blueberries/cranberries.
</li>
	<li>Press mixture into an 8 by 8 loaf pan (a modification that we made to keep everything crisper and help the bars to hold together).
	</li>
	<li>Cook in a preheated oven at 325 degrees for 10 minutes.
</li>
	<li>Remove from oven, sprinkle a ¼ cup of shredded coconut on top and place under broiler until top begins to brown.
	</li>
	<li>Let cool for 10-15 minutes. Cut into 12 pieces/bars.
Enjoy or stack on wax paper/parchment and store in an airtight container.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Note: You can also add dark chocolate chips instead of the cranberries/blueberries (available at Whole Foods or health food store). 
If you add the chips while the mixing bowl is warm (from the coconut oil/almond butter mixture), they will melt into the mixture and 
you will have yourself a chocolate primal bar. Alternatively, you can just let the mix cool, then add the chips, then refrigerate the
 pan to get chocolate chip primal bars. The bars stick together pretty well without being cooked.
