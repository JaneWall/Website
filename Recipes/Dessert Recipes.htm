<h4 id="Banana Nut Bread">Banana Nut Bread</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 1 1/2 hours</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
    <tr><td width="40%">1 cup (2 sticks) butter<br/>
   	2 cups sugar<br/>
	2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br/>
  	3 eggs<br/>
	2 cups mashed bananas<br/>
	</td>

    	<td width="60%" valign="top">
	3 cups flour<br/>
	1 teaspoon baking soda<br/>
	3/4 teaspoon salt<br/>
   	1 cup chopped pecans<br/>
    </td></tr>
</table>

<p><em>Directions: </em>Turn on oven to 350 degrees. Soften the butter a little. Beat together the sugar, butter, and vanilla until creamy. Add the eggs and mashed bananas and mix up.  Add the flour, baking soda, salt,and nuts.  Pour into a greased loaf pan.  Bake for 1 hour, 10 minutes.</p>

<h4 id="Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies">Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 1 hour</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
    <tr><td width="40%">3/4 cup flour<br/>
   	1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br/>
  	1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>
	1 cup oatmeal<br/>
	1/2 cup butter (1 stick)<br/>
	1/2 cup sugar<br/></td>

    	<td width="60%">
	1/2 cup brown sugar<br/>
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
   	1 egg<br/>
	1/2 cup chopped nuts (I use pecans)<br/>
	1 - 6 ounce package of semi-sweet chocolate chips (or can use a little more if you want them full of chips<br/></td></tr>
</table>

<p><em>Directions: </em>Turn on oven to 375 degrees.  Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt. If you have a sifter, 
this is a good way to mix them up, but not necessary. Add the oatmeal and set aside. Soften the butter or margarine by either 
leaving it out at room temperature for a bit or by putting it in the microwave for about 20 seconds. In a large mixing bowl, 
beat together the butter, sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla until it is creamy.  Then add the egg and mix a little more. 
 Add the flour mixture and mix well.  Then add the nuts and chocolate chips.  If you are not using a non-stick cookie sheet, 
 grease the sheet you are going to use with oil or margarine.  Use a spoon to scoop up the cookie dough and put on cookie sheet 
 in rounded spoonfuls.  You can probably fit about 12 - 15 scoops on a sheet.  Put in the oven and bake for about 10 - 12 minutes.  
 Take up and let cool on a piece of waxed paper or aluminum foil.  Fill cookie sheet again and put in oven.  Keep going until you 
 have used all the dough.  Once they have cooled, you can stack them up in a cookie jar or on a plate.</p>

<p><em>Directions: </em>Cream butter, then add sugar gradually. Melt chocolate in microwave and blend in.  Stir in hot water a little at a time,
adding just enough to give a good spreading consistency.  Beat until fluffy.  Add vanilla.  Spread onto cooled cake.  Makes enough frosting for
 tops and sides of 2 9-inch layers or 2 dozen cupcakes.</p>

a whisk to blend.  Add 2/3 of the flour mixture to the egg mixture and whisk until smooth.  Add 1/4 cup of the hot milk to the egg mixture and mix well.
Add another 1/4 cup of the milk and mix.  Add the remaining flour mixture and whisk until smooth.</p>
<p>Bring the remaining milk back to a boil and add it to the base all at once, stirring constantly until smooth.  Immediately stir in the butter
until fully incorporated.  The mixture should have the consistency of heavy cream.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.  Then beat in the sugar and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form.  Add the cocoa powder and cognac.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375.  Butter and sugar some ramekins (4 1/2 ounce - 8 ounce size) and place in baking pan. Fold 1/4 of the egg whites into the souffle base and
 stir to combine.  Then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.  Divide the batter among the ramekins.  Put hot water in the pan around the ramekins to reach about halfway
 up the sides of the dishes.  Bake for 20 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.</p>

<h4 id="Ice Cream Pie">Aunt Dot's Ice Cream Pie</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 15 minutes to make, plus freezer time of at least an hour</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
    <tr><td>1 small package of semi-sweet chocolate chips<br/>
   	1/2 stick margarine (4 Tablespoons)<br/>
  	1 cup of Rice Krispies cereal<br/>
   	1/2 gallon of vanilla ice cream (Breyer's is best)<br/></td></tr>
</table>

<p><em>Directions: </em>Take the ice cream out of the freezer to be getting a little soft.  Put the chocolate chips into a
 bowl and put in the microwave for 1 minute.  Add the margarine and put back in the microwave for another minute (or until melted slightly). 
  Stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth.  Add the Rice Krispies and stir together.  Grease a pie pan with margarine.  
  Put the chocolate mixture into the pie pan and shape into a crust as well as you can.  Put the pie pan in the freezer for just a few minutes. 
   This will harden the crust so it is easier to form.  Finish forming into the shape of a pie crust and put it in the freezer for at least 10 more minutes. 
    By now the ice cream should be soft enough to work with.  So, take the crust out of the freezer and add ice cream to fill the pie pan to the top. 
     Smooth out on top with the back of the spoon.  Put it back in the freezer to harden.  
     If you want, you can drizzle a little Hershey's syrup on the top just before you serve it.</p>
