<h4 id="Ciabatta">Ciabatta</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 2- 3 hours</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top"><em>For biga</em><br/>
	1 cup plus 1 tablespoon room-temperature water (75°F to 80°F)<br/>
	1 1/4-ounce package dry yeast<br/>
	3 1/3 cups bread flour<br/>
    </td><td valign="top">
	<em>For dough<em/><br/>
	3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons room-temperature water (75°F to 80°F)<br/>
	Pinch of dry yeast<br/>
	1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons semolina flour (or pasta flour)<br/>
    </td><td valign="top">
	2 1/2 teaspoons salt<br/>
	Additional semolina flour<br/>
    </td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em></p>
<p><em>Make biga:</em>
Place water in processor. Sprinkle yeast over. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 8 minutes. Add 1 cup flour; process until blended. Scrape down sides of work bowl. Add 1 cup flour; repeat processing and scraping. Add remaining 1 1/3 cups flour. Process until small moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball (dough will be firm); place in large bowl. Cover; chill overnight (biga will soften, resembling thick oatmeal in texture).</p>

<p><em>Make dough:</em>
Pull biga into walnut-size pieces; place in a clean large bowl. Add water, yeast and 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons semolina. Using 1 hand, squeeze ingredients together 2 minutes. 
Work dough 4 minutes by scooping sections from sides of bowl and pressing into center, blending into very soft, shaggy mass. Using spatula, scrape dough from sides of bowl into center. Let dough rest in bowl, uncovered, 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Sprinkle salt over dough. Using 1 hand, knead dough by rotating bowl 1/4 turn at a time, scooping dough from sides and folding down into center until dough starts to come away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Scrape dough from hand and sides of bowl. Cover bowl with towel; let dough rest 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Rotating bowl 1/4 turn at a time, fold dough over onto itself 6 times; turn dough over in bowl. Cover with towel and let dough rest in bowl 20 minutes.</p>

<p><em>Bake bread:</em>
Preheat oven to 425°F. Sprinkle work surface with additional semolina. Turn dough out onto semolina. Using pastry scraper or large knife, cut dough in half; keep halves separated. 
Let stand, uncovered, 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Sprinkle 2 large baking sheets with additional semolina. Transfer each dough half, semolina side up, to 1 sheet. Stretch each dough half to 16x4-inch rectangle. Press fingertips into dough in several places to dimple surface (characteristic of this bread). Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Double-wrap in aluminum foil to freeze.)</p>

<p>Makes 2 loaves.</p>

<h4 id="Risotto">Wild Mushroom and Asparagus Risotto</h4>
<p><em>Time Needed: 1 hour</em></p>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top">
6 cups chicken broth <br/>
1 cup dry white wine <br/>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter <br/>
1 cup finely chopped onion <br/>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br/>
2 cups Arborio rice <br/></td>
<td valign="top">
5 ounces wild mushrooms, cooked and coarsely chopped, approximately 3/4 cup <br/>
7 ounces asparagus, cooked and cut into 1-inch pieces, approximately 1 1/2 cups
<br/>
2 ounces grated Parmesan, approximately 1/2 cup <br/>
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest <br/>
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br/></td>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>In an electric kettle or medium saucepan with 
a lid, combine chicken broth and white wine and heat just to simmering. Keep 
warm.</p>

<p>In a large 3 to 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add 
the onions and a pinch of salt and sweat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 
the rice and stir. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until the grains are translucent 
around the edges. Be careful not to allow the grains or the onions to brown. </p>
<p>Reduce the heat to low. Add enough of the wine and chicken stock just to 
cover the top of the rice. Stir or move the pan often, until the liquid is 
completely absorbed into rice. Once absorbed, add another amount of liquid just 
to cover the rice and continue stirring or moving as before. There should be 
just enough liquid left to repeat 1 more time. It should take approximately 35 
to 40 minutes for all of the liquid to be absorbed. After the last addition of 
liquid has been mostly absorbed, add the mushrooms and asparagus and stir until 
risotto is creamy and asparagus is heated through. Remove from the heat and stir 
in the Parmesan, lemon zest, and nutmeg. Taste and season, to taste, with salt 
and freshly ground black pepper. </p>
<p>*Cook's Note: If fresh wild mushrooms are not available, reconstituted dried 
mushrooms can be used instead. Place 2 ounces of dried mushrooms into a bowl and 
cover with warm water. Allow to sit for about 30 minutes or until all the 
mushrooms are soft and pliable. </p>
