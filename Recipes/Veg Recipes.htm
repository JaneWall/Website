<h4 id="Baked Eggs">Baked eggs</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 40 minutes </em>   <br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top">fresh baby spinach (2 cups or 1 very large handful per person)<br/>
	eggs - 2 large eggs per person<br/>
	heavy whipping cream (1 Tablespoon per person)<br/></td>
	<td valign="top">
	salt and pepper<br/>
	bacon bits - 1 teaspoon per person<br/>
	finely grated parmesan cheese - 1 Tablespoon per person
	    </td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>Preheat oven to 350.  Boil water, then add some salt to water and cook the spinach for 1 minute.  Drain spinach well and
get as much of the water out of it as possible.  Rub butter inside 10-12 ounce ramekins (this is a small baking dish with straight sides ... anything 
small that will go in the oven and hold the spinach and eggs should work fine).  Each person will have their own ramekin.  Put spinach in the ramekins, 
making a little indention in the middle of the spinach so the eggs will nestle into the spinach.  Break two eggs into each dish on top of the spinach.  
Add a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper to each dish, then add the bacon bits and whipping cream.  Bake in oven for 14 minutes.  Add the parmesan cheese
 and return to oven for 2 minutes.  If you don't like your egg yolks runny, add about 2-3 minutes to the cooking time.  Serve hot.

<h4 id="Broccoli">Broccoli and most other cooked vegetables</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 5 - 20 minutes </em>   (Spinach - 2 minutes; Broccoli - 5 minutes; Pole beans - 20 minutes)<br/>

<tr><td>fresh vegetables<br/>
	salt (about a teaspoon)<br/>
    </td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em>Rinse off the vegetables.  Prepare the vegetables for cooking.  For broccoli, cut into spears.  For spinach, 
remove any large stems.  For pole beans, string and snap into pieces. Put a pot of water on to boil.  The pot should be large enough to 
hold the vegetables with room to spare.  Once the water is boiling, add the salt to the water. Then add the broccoli or whatever vegetable
 you want to cook.  Do not put the top back on the pot.  Cook for just a few minutes until you can stick a fork in the vegetable without a
  lot of resistance (this is called fork tender).  As soon as this occurs, drain the vegetables and serve immediately.  If you aren't going 
  to eat them all at this meal, rinse what you don't plan to eat with cold water.  This will keep it from continuing to cook from the heat. </p>

<h4 id="Caesar Salad">Caesar Salad (vegetarian)</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 20-30 minutes - most can be done ahead</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top">18 to 24 crisp, narrow leaves from the hearts of 2 heads of romaine lettuce, or a package of romaine hearts (about 1 pound)<br/>
	1 cup plain toasted croutons<br/>
	1 large clove garlic, peeled<br/>
   	1/4 cup or more excellent olive oil<br/>
	salt<br/>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
	1 large egg<br/>
	freshly ground black pepper<br/>
 	1 whole lemon, halved and seeded<br/>
	Worcestershire sauce<br/>
  	2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese, imported Parmigiano-Reggiano only<br/>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em></p>
<p><em>Preparing the salad components:</em>
You will probably need 2 large heads of romaine for 3 people — or use a commercially prepared package of "romaine hearts," if they appear 
fresh and fine. From a large head remove the outside leaves until you get down to the cone where the leaves are 4 to 7 inches in length — you'll
 want 6 to 8 of these leaves per serving. Separate the leaves and wash them carefully to keep them whole, roll them loosely in clean towels, and 
 keep refrigerated until serving time. (Save the remains for other salads — fortunately, romaine keeps reasonably well under refrigeration.</p>

<p>To flavor the croutons, crush the garlic clove with the flat of a chef's knife, sprinkle on 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and mince well. Pour about a 
tablespoon of olive oil on the garlic and mash again with the knife, rubbing and pressing to make a soft purée. </p>

<p>Scrape the purée into the frying pan, add another tablespoon of oil, and warm over low-medium heat. Add the croutons and toss for a minute or two
 to infuse them with the garlic oil, then remove from the heat. (For a milder garlic flavor, you can strain the purée though a small sieve into a pan
  before adding the extra croutons. Discard the bits of garlic.)</p> 

<p>To coddle the egg, bring a small saucepan of water to a simmer. Pierce the large end of the egg with a pushpin to prevent cracking, then simmer 
for exactly 1 minute. </p>

<p><em>Mixing and serving the Caesar:</em>
Dress the salad just before serving. Have ready all the dressing ingredients and a salad fork and spoon for tossing. </p>

<p>Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the romaine leaves and toss to coat, lifting the leaves from the bottom and turning them towards you, so
 they tumble over like a wave. Sprinkle them with a generous pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper, toss once or twice, then add the lemon juice
  and several drops of the Worcestershire, and toss again. Taste for seasoning, and add more, if needed. </p>

<p>Crack the egg and drop it right on the romaine leaves, then toss to break it up and coat the leaves. Sprinkle on the cheese, toss briefly, then 
add the croutons (and the garlicky bits in the pan, if you wish) and toss for the last time, just to mix them into the salad.</p> 

<p>Arrange 6 or more leaves in a single layer on individual plates, scatter the croutons all around, and serve. Serves 2-3. (Recipe reprinted from 
Julia Child and Jacques Pepin)

<h4 id="Caesar Salad Anchovy">Caesar Salad with Anchovies</h4>
<em>Time Needed: 20-30 minutes - most can be done ahead</em><br/>
<em>Ingredients</em><br/>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top">18 to 24 crisp, narrow leaves from the hearts of 2 heads of romaine lettuce, or a package of romaine hearts (about 1 pound)<br/>

  	3 oz. freshly grated parmesan cheese, imported Parmigiano-Reggiano only<br/>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><em>Directions: </em></p>
<p>To flavor the croutons, crush the garlic clove with the flat of a chef's knife, sprinkle on 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and mince well.
 Pour about a tablespoon of olive oil on the garlic and mash again with the knife, rubbing and pressing to make a soft purée. </p>

<p>Scrape the purée into the frying pan, add another tablespoon of oil, and warm over low-medium heat. 
Add the croutons and toss for a minute or two to infuse them with the garlic oil, then remove from the heat. Toast in the oven if desired.
(For a milder garlic flavor, you can strain the purée though a small sieve into a pan before adding the extra croutons. Discard the bits of garlic.)</p>
 
<p>Rub the inside of a large wooden bowl with the garlic cloves. Remove the garlic cloves, and finely chop. 
Add the egg yolks, remaining garlic, anchovies and mustard to the bowl. Whisk until all of the ingredients are incorporated. Whisk in the lemon juice. 
Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, while whisking constantly. Whisk until all of the ingredients are incorporated. Season the dressing with salt and pepper. 
Gently tear the lettuce into bit-size portions and add to the salad bowl. 
Using a hand-held zester, grate the cheese into the bowl. Add the croutons. 
Toss the salad completely and reseason if necessary. Serve the salad on cold salad plates.</p>
